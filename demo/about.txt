If you'd like to build a demo or an interactive playground for this project,
edit the files in this directory.

With `grunt demo`, the index.html file is displayed in the browser, and the
demo, src and spec directories are monitored for changes. If anything is altered
there, the grunt task will live-reload the demo page.
